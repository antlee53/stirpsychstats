##Question 4

Below is a vector of numbers. Standardise the numbers in this vector and save the result as `z.numbers`.

```{r question_4.1-setup}
numbers <- c(73,77,86,81,75,83,89,121,104,77,113,104,97,107,99,110,103,84,103,99,95,93,113,83,103,92,92,107,111,103,104,110,109,102,96,88,108,101,92,86)
```

```{r question_4.1, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines = 12}
numbers <- c(73,77,86,81,75,83,89,121,104,77,113,104,97,107,99,110,103,84,103,99,95,93,113,83,103,92,92,107,111,103,104,110,109,102,96,88,108,101,92,86)

z.numbers
```

```{r question_4.1-hint-1}
To standardise a list of numbers, you will need to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the numbers.
```

```{r question_4.1-hint-2}
The equation to standardise a number is to subtract the mean, then divide the standard deviation.

Next hint will show the solution...
```

```{r question_4.1-solution}
numbers.mean <- mean(numbers)
numbers.sd <- sd(numbers)

z.numbers <- (numbers - numbers.mean)/numbers.sd
```

```{r question_4.1-check}
checker()
```
