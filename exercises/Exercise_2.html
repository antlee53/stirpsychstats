<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the second of the weekly exercises. These exercises are designed to reinforce content taught in the second demonstration. Typically, they consist of quiz questions and/or R exercises that require you to enter code into a box. These exercises are split into beginner and advance sections. It is expected that students can complete the beginner sections of each weekly exercise, with the advanced sections designed for students who want an extra challenge or learn additional functions in R. If you are struggling, each exercise comes with a number of hints that may be helpful.</p>

<h2>Advanced Exercises</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you will want to analyse data, but the variables of interest are in separate data.frames - maybe the data are from different sources, or collected using different programs. This week’s advanced exercises focuses on merging two separate data.frames in R.</p>
<p>NOTE: Content in these advanced exercises are NOT covered in demonstrations. The purpose is to provide additional challenges or new R content for students looking for a challenge. Also, there is no code checking for advanced exercises - you are required to evaluate whether the code meets the objective on your own. However, if you want an example of a possible answer, you can click through the hints.</p>
<div id="section-question-a1---joining-data.frames" class="section level3">
<h3>Question A1 - Joining Data.frames</h3>
<p>The R package <code>tidyverse</code> provides some handy functions for joining data.frames. Join functions are most useful in situations where different variables from the same participants are stored in separate data.frames. Here are some of the more useful join functions:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="15%" />
<col width="84%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Function name</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>left_join()</td>
<td>Keeps all the data in the first table, and adds columns from the second to rows that match.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>right_join()</td>
<td>Keeps all the data in the second table, and adds columns from the first to rows that match.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>inner_join()</td>
<td>Only returns rows that have a match in both tables.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>full_join()</td>
<td>Retains all information from both tables. If a row does not have a match in one table, it will receive a NA value for the other table’s columns.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each of the above functions joins two data.frames together. How they differ is what rows the function decides to retain/exclude. All of the above join functions have the same syntax:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>XXX_join(x, y, by = NULL, suffix = c(&quot;.x&quot;,&quot;.y&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Let’s break down each or the arguments</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="11%" />
<col width="88%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Argument</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>x</td>
<td>The first table you want to join, known as the “left” table.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>y</td>
<td>The second table you want to join, known as the “right” table.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>by</td>
<td>The columns (variable names) you wish to join the two tables on (i.e., the variable you are ‘matching’ on). There must be a variable with this name in both tables.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>suffix</td>
<td>If columns have the same name in the two tables, you can add a suffix so you can distinguish between the two. The default for this is “.x” for the left table, and “.y” for the right table.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this and the following questions, we will give examples of how these join functions work.</p>
<p>In the code below, we use a <code>full_join()</code> function to join the two data.frames <code>data.left</code> and <code>data.right</code>. Edit this code so that the columns “match” on the participant ID column. (Note: If you do not specify any columns to join on, these functions are smart enough to determine the best variable to match on, but it best to get in the habit of always specifying a column using the ‘by’ argument)</p>

<h3>Question A2 - left_join()</h3>
<p><code>left_join()</code> is one of the more useful join functions. This function keeps all data from the first (left) table and joins all columns that has a matching row in the second (right) table. This is particularly helpful if there are cases (rows) in the right table that are not in the left (and is therefore not of interest to us), or if columns in the right table apply to multiple rows in the left table. By carefully considering which data.frame is on the left vs. right, in almost all cases, <code>left_join()</code> or <code>full_join()</code> will suit your needs.</p>
<p>In the box below, there are two data.frames. The <code>data.left</code> table from Question A1, and a new data.frame with country-level statistics called <code>data.countries</code>. Use <code>left_join()</code> to join these data.frames.</p>

<p>Notice when using <code>left_join()</code>, there are no matches for “Wales” in the left data.frame, so this information is removed when using <code>left_join()</code>. Also, there are multiple matches for one country (e.g., Scotland); this function will join on both matched rows appropriately. Re-run the code above, but instead use <code>full_join()</code>, and compare the results to when you use <code>left_join()</code>.</p>

<h3>Question A3 - Matching on Multiple Variables</h3>
<p>What if you need the join function to match on more than one variable? Thankfully, the join functions can accomodate this. Using the ‘by’ argument, rather than specifying one column, you can specify any number by putting the column names in a character vector. Remember, both data.frames need to have all match variables.</p>
<p>Below is data collected from three participants, who were tested in two countries. Currently, the data is in two separate data.frames. Use <code>left_join()</code> to merge the two data.frames correctly.</p>

<h3>Question A4 - Suffixes</h3>
<p>How about a situation where both data.frames have variables with the same name, but you aren’t joining on these variables. By taking advantage of the ‘suffix’ argument in the join functions, you can create a way to unambiguously distinguish between the variables from the different data.frames. This argument accepts a character vector with a length of two. The first element of the vector will be pasted on the end of the variables from the left data.frame, while the second element will be pasted on the end of the variables on the right data.frame.</p>
<p>A common situation where this could occur is data collected from the same participant at two different time points. In the box below, there are two data.frames collected from 6 participants, each data.frame representing data collected at a separate time point. Edit the code below to correctly join the data.frames.</p>

<h3>Question A5 - bind_rows()</h3>
<p>Up to now, we have exclusively dealt with join functions, which adds variables from one data.frame to another. A totally different way of merging data.frames together is combining rows. This is common when you have two data.frames with the same variables but different rows, e.g. data collected from different participants on the same task. This can be achieved by using the <code>bind_rows()</code> function. This function simply accepts two arguments: the two data.frames you wish to join.</p>
<p>In the example below, we have two data.frames that were taken from two different computers running the same experiment. We wish to combine the data.frames by adding the rows of one data.frame to another so that we can analyse the data altogether.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>complete.data &lt;- bind_rows(data_computer1,data_computer2)</code></pre>
<p>A couple of things to note. First, between the data.frames, the number of columns must be the same and they must have the same names (though they don’t necessarily have to be in the same order). Second, if a row is duplicated between the two tables, the row will also be duplicated in the resulting table.</p>
<p>In the box below, use the <code>bind_row()</code> function to join the two data.frames about planets.</p>
