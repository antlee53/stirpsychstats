<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the third of the weekly exercises. These exercises are designed to reinforce content taught each week. Typically, they consist of quiz questions and R exercises that require you to enter code into a box. These exercises are split into beginner and advance sections. It is expected that students can complete the beginner sections of each weekly exercise, with the advanced sections designed for students who want an extra challenge or learn additional functions in R.If you are struggling, each exercise comes with a number of hints that may be helpful.</p>

<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>In the code below, there is a data.frame called <code>personality</code>, where six participants were measured on the Big-5 personality dimensions (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism). However, you are only interested in the conscientiousness and neuroticism dimensions.

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>You have conducted a study measuring how many minutes participants engage in physical exercise each day. You have measured 6 participants every day for a week - this data is saved below as <code>phys_exer</code>. You wish to analyse the total number of minutes participants spent exercising during the week. Use a tidyverse function to create a new data.frame called <code>phys_exer_total</code> with a new variable called <code>total</code> which is the sum of minutes across the seven days.</p>

<h3>Question 6</h3>
<p>After showing your supervisor your work from Question 5, they flippantly remark that perhaps you should analyse the mean number of minutes participants exercise per day, rather than the total number of minutes across the week. Edit the code below so that the variable <code>total</code> is the mean and not the sum.</p>

<h3>Question 9</h3>
<p>You are interested in how older adults make judgements of trustworthiness. You have conducted a study with 40 participants, where participants gave ratings of trustworthiness to 12 stimuli. This data is saved as the object <code>ratings</code>. However, after collecting the data, you noticed there is an issue with stimuli_10 and stimuli_11, and they needs to be excluded. Prepare the data.frame for data analysis by doing the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Remove the problematic variables.</li>
<li>Remove participants that are not 65 years or older.</li>
<li>Calculate a new variable called <code>total</code> that is the sum of the remaining <code>stimuli</code> variables.</li>
</ol>
<p>Save the new data.frame as <code>ratings_final</code>.</p>

<h2>Advanced Exercises</h2>
<p>Up to now, we have covered some of the helpful <code>tidyverse</code> functions, but there are many more that are useful to data cleaning and preparing a data.frame for analysis. This week’s advance exercises focuses on introducing a few more. Note that even after completing these exercises, we still wouldn’t have covered every tidyverse function.</p>
<div id="section-question-a1---arrange" class="section level3">
<h3>Question A1 - arrange()</h3>
<p>The <code>arrange()</code> function reorders the rows in your data.frame according to a columns in the data.frame. Like all tidyverse functions, the first argument is the data.frame you wish to manipulate. The second argument is the name of variable you wish to sort by.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>arranged.data &lt;- arrange(data,variable_name)</code></pre>
<p>If the variable is numeric, the data.frame will be sorted into ascending numerical order according to that variable. If the variable is a character, the data.frame will be sorted into alphabetical order according to that variable. If you want to reverse the order, use the <code>desc()</code> function within <code>arrange()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>arranged.data &lt;- arrange(data,desc(variable_name))</code></pre>
<p>In the box below is the planets data from Exercise 2. Use the <code>arrange()</code> function to sort the planets from most to least number of moons.</p>

<h3>Question A2 - rename()</h3>
<p>Use the <code>rename()</code> function to rename the variables in your data.frame. In the code below, we rename three variables in a data.frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>renamed.data &lt;- rename(data,
                       new.variable.name1 = old.variable.name1,
                       new.variable.name2 = old.variable.name2,
                       new.variable.name3 = old.variable.name3)</code></pre>
<p>A few things to note. First, to ease readability, we have spaced out this function across multiple lines. Second, the new name of the variable goes on the left of the <code>=</code> symbol, while the original name goes on the right. A common mistake is to mix this up!</p>
<p>In the box below is the planets data from above, but without informative variable names. Use the <code>rename()</code> function to fix this. The new variables should be <code>planet</code>, <code>diameter</code>, <code>orbit</code>, <code>temperature</code>, and <code>moons</code> in that order.</p>

<h3>Question A3 - separate()</h3>
<p>One of the key tennants of data cleaning is that each cell of your data.frame should only have one variable. However, if importing data from different programs, this may not be the default - sometimes, a single variable will hold multiple values, like in the example below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>imported.data</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["participant_id"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["age_y_m"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["mean_sd"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"24_5","3":"4.34 sd=1.22"},{"1":"2","2":"30_1","3":"5.28 sd=2.12"},{"1":"3","2":"27_2","3":"3.74 sd=1.58"},{"1":"4","2":"21_12","3":"6.10 sd=2.02"},{"1":"5","2":"33_10","3":"4.61 sd=1.81"},{"1":"6","2":"26_7","3":"3.99 sd=2.59"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>In the data.frame above, there are three columns; however, multiple values are saved in two of these columns: First, age should have separate columns for year and month, while the mean and standard deviation scores should also be separated into separate columns.</p>
<p>Below is the code that separates the ‘age_y_m’ variable into two:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>imported.data2 &lt;- separate(imported.data,
                           col = age_y_m,
                           into = c(&quot;age_y&quot;,&quot;age_m&quot;),
                           sep = &quot;_&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s break down each or the arguments above. As always, the first argument is the data.frame you are performing the tidyverse function on. The ‘col’ argument specifies the name of the variable you wish to split (in the example above, the ‘age_y_m’). The ‘into’ argument specifies the new variable names of your separated columns. You need to specify the correct number of columns in a character vector (in our example, the two new column names are ‘age_y’ and ‘age_m’). The ‘sep’ argument specifies the character that separates your new column (in the example, the age in years and months are separated by an underscore, so we set <code>sep = "_"</code>.</p>
<p>In the box below, use the <code>separate()</code> function to split the <code>mean_sd</code> variable into separate columns for <code>mean</code> and <code>sd</code>.</p>

<h3>Question A4 - unite()</h3>
<p>Occassionally, you will need to do the opposite of the <code>separate()</code> function, and combine multiple columns to one. This can be achieved with the <code>unite()</code> function.</p>

<p>Again, let’s break down each argument. As always, the first argument is the data.frame. The ‘col’ argument is the name of the new variable once columns have been combined. After this, you simply list the column names you wish to combine. In both examples above, we are only pasting two columns together, but this function easily accomodates more than two. Finally, the ‘sep’ argument dictates how the two values will be separated within the one column (in the case of age, this is an underscore: "_").</p>
<p>You wish to conduct a meta-analysis across 6 papers. In the box below, the data.frame called <code>meta.analysis</code> has the effect size of the 6 papers; however, the direction and value of the effect size are saved in separate variables. Use the <code>unite()</code> function to combine the two columns. Then, calculate the mean of the effect size.</p>

<h3>Question A5 - recode()</h3>
<p>You can use the <code>recode()</code> function to recode individual values within a variable. To use this function, use it within a <code>mutate()</code> function.</p>
<p>In the data.frame below, we want to recode the values “Yes” and “No” in the complete variable to <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> respectively.</p>

<p>To review how the <code>mutate()</code> function works, see this week’s workbook. The first argument for the <code>recode()</code> function is the variable you wish to recode. Afterwards, specify the old value and then the new value you wish to recode it to (separated by a <code>=</code> symbol). You need to be exhausive with your list (i.e., all old values must have a new value). Also, regardless of the class of your variable, all old values must be contained within quotation marks.</p>
<p>In the box below, participants completed a three-item questionnaire measuring attitudes towards violent video games. Participants rated their agreements to statements on a 7-point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, through to 7 = Strongly Agree). You require to add these values together, but first, Item 2 needs to be reverse-coded. Use the <code>recode()</code> function to acheive this, then calculate the total score on the questionnaire.</p>
