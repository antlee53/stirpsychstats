<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the sixth of the weekly exercises. These exercises are designed to reinforce content taught each week. Typically, they consist of quiz questions and R exercises that require you to enter code into a box. These exercises are split into beginner and advance sections. It is expected that students can complete the beginner sections of each weekly exercise, with the advanced sections designed for students who want an extra challenge or learn additional functions in R. If you are struggling, each exercise comes with a number of hints that may be helpful.</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>In the data.frame <code>pain.data</code>, you’ve asked participants to rate (on a 5-point scale) how much chronic pain they experience across 5 days. Compute a mean pain rating across the 5 days and test whether this correlates with level of social support. Save the correlation output as <code>pain.cor</code>.</p>

<p>You are interested in factors that predict women’s engagement in collective action. You measure a number of personality traits, including Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), Hostile Sexism (HS) and Benevolent Sexism (BS). Run an unstandardised linear regression to determine the unique contribution each has on women’s likelihood of engaging in collective action (CA). Save the regression output as <code>CA.summary</code>.</p>

<h3>Question 6</h3>
<p>You want to know which predictor from the analysis in Question 6 has the biggest effect; however, the measures of SDO, HS, and BS are on different scales. Therefore, you are required to get standardised coefficients to determine which predictor has the largest effect. For the analysis in Question 6, get the standardised coefficients.</p>

<h3>Question 8</h3>
<p>You conducted a study investigating whether priming participants with words about childhood increases the speed of recollection of childhood memory. Participants were assigned to either a prime or no prime condition (coded as -.5 and .5 respectively) before being asked to recall a childhood memory, with recall time being recorded. Run a standardised linear regression using the <code>lm()</code> and <code>lm.beta()</code> functions to determine whether recall time is associated with the priming condition, while controlling for participant’s age. The data.frame for this question is called <code>memory.data</code>, save the output of the standardised linear regression as <code>memory.summary</code>.</p>

<h2>Advanced Exercises</h2>
<p>This week’s advanced exercises focuses on conducting analyses with a categorical DV.</p>
<div id="section-question-a1---chi-square-goodness-of-fit-test" class="section level3">
<h3>Question A1 - Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test</h3>
<p>As covered in the lecture series, the chi-square goodness of fit test is used to compare the observed distribution of a single categorical variable with an expected distribution.</p>
<p>The function that performs a chi-square goodness of fit test is the <code>chisq.test()</code> function. There are two inputs we require. First, is a numeric vector with the observed frequencies. Second, is the probability of the expected frequencies (argument named <code>p</code>).</p>
<p>For instance, if we conducted a study that counted the frequency of 100 people’s favourite colour, and observed 20 people reported “red”, 35 people reported “green”, and 45 people reported “blue”, then the first argument would be:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>c(20,35,45)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 20 35 45</code></pre>
<p>If we expect an equal distribution amongst the three colours, our expected probabilities would be represented as:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>c(1/3,1/3,1/3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.3333333 0.3333333 0.3333333</code></pre>
<p>Altogether, to conduct the chi-square goodness of fit test, we input these vectors into the <code>chisq.test()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>chisq.test(c(20,35,45),p = c(1/3,1/3,1/3))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Chi-squared test for given probabilities
## 
## data:  c(20, 35, 45)
## X-squared = 9.5, df = 2, p-value = 0.008652</code></pre>
<p>In the code box below, you have conducted a study investigating people’s choices when donating to four different charities. You expect that people would donate to each charity equally. Calculate the frequencies from the data, and conduct a chi-square goodness of fit test. To get the observed frequencies from a vector, you could use the <code>table()</code> function.</p>

<h3>Question A2 - Chi-Square Test of Independence</h3>
<p>The chi-square test of independence is used to determine if the distribution of frequencies of a categorical DV are different at different levels of the IV.</p>
<p>The chi-square test of independence uses the same function as the chi-square goodness of fit test, but the inputs are different. The function is smart enough to know which test to conduct given which inputs it receives.</p>
<p>If you input a contingency table that has 2 variables, then the function knows to conduct a chi-square test of independence. Contingency tables can be created using the <code>table()</code> function. A two-variable contingency table will be created from a data.frame that only has two variables in it. Therefore, you can use the <code>select()</code> function (covered in Workbook 3) to create a data.frame that only includes the two variables that you’re interested in.</p>
<p>For example, the following code will create a contingency table of <code>var1</code> and <code>var2</code> in the data.frame called <code>data</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>c.table &lt;- select(data,var1,var2) %&gt;%
  table()</code></pre>
<p>In the code box below, you measure the exercise levels (categorised into 4 categories) of a group of smokers and non-smokers. You predict that non-smokers are more likely to exercise than non-smokers.</p>

<h3>Question A3 - Logistic Regression</h3>
<p>A logistic regression is used when you have a categorical DV and a continuous IV. The most simple scenario is when the DV is binary (i.e., only has two categories). The two categories of the DV are usually coded as <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> (if it is not coded this way, R will usually recode it for you!).</p>
<p>To conduct a logistic regression in R, you can use the <code>glm()</code> function. In this instance, ‘glm’ stands for Generalised Linear Model, and can be used for many different types of analysis. Like most analysis functions, the <code>glm()</code> function accepts a formula and a data.frame. We also need to tell the function which type of analysis to conduct. This is done via the <code>family</code> argument. To conduct a binomial logistic regression, we set this argument to “binomial”. Much like with the <code>lm()</code> function, to view the results in an interpretable way you must use the <code>summary()</code> function.</p>
<p>Altogether, this becomes:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#The DV must be a categorical variable with two levels.
model &lt;- glm(DV ~ IV,data = data,family = &quot;binomial&quot;)
summary(model)</code></pre>
<p>In the code box below, you have conducted a study on factors the predict whether someone is admitted to the emergency clinic at a hospital. You predict that the higher level of pain someone reports, the more likely they are to be admitted compared to refused. Conduct a logistic regression to test this hypothesis.</p>

<h3>Question A4 - Logistic Regression with Multiple Predictors</h3>
<p>Much like with a normal regression, there can be multiple predictors in a logistic regression.</p>
<p>In the code box below, adapt the code to conduct a logistic regression to find the unique effects of pain ratings, amount of blood loss, and level of consciousness on frequency of being admitted to an emergency clinic.</p>
