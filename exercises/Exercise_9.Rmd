## Introduction

This is the second-to-last of the weekly exercises. Almost there! These exercises are designed to reinforce content taught each week. Typically, they consist of quiz questions and R exercises that require you to enter code into a box. These exercises are usually split into beginner and advance sections; however, this week all exercises are advanced. It is expected that students can complete the beginner sections of each weekly exercise, with the advanced sections designed for students who want an extra challenge or learn additional functions in R. If you are struggling, each exercise comes with a number of hints that may be helpful.

## Basic Exercises

This week's exercises covers structural equation modelling and model comparisons, which are quite advanced statistical techniques. Therefore, all exercises this week could be considered "Advanced". Completing these exercises may help with your understanding of Stuctural Equation Modelling and content covered in the lecture, but you only need to complete them if you are keen to test your R skills.

## Advanced Exercises

### Question 1

Look at the formula below, then answer the following quiz question.

```{r question_1,exercise = TRUE,exercise.lines = 6}

formula <- '
  var1 ~ var2 + var3
  var2 ~ var4 + var5
  var3 ~ var6 + var7
'

```

```{r question_1-quiz}
quiz(
  question("The `lavaan` formula above includes which of the following relationships (select all appropriate answers):",
    answer("var1 is predicted from var2 and var3.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("var2 is predicted from var4 and var5.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("var3 is predicted from var6 and var7,",correct = TRUE),
    answer("var2 and var3 are covariates.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("var3 is a latent variable."),
    answer("var6 and var7 directly influences var1."),
    answer("The model includes a direct path between var4 and var1."),
    answer("var1 is a latent variable that explains var2 and var3."),allow_retry = TRUE,random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

### Question 2

Below is a `lavaan` formula. Edit the code so that the relationship between 'musical ability' and 'rhythm' is labelled as `a`, and the relationship between 'musical ability' and 'pitch' is `b`.

```{r question_2-setup}

```

```{r question_2, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines = 12}
formula <- '
  musical_ability ~ rhythm
  musical_ability ~ pitch
  pitch ~~ rhythm
'
```

```{r question_2-hint-1}
The easiest way to define a path is using the `*` symbol.
```

```{r question_2-hint-2}
Another way to define a path is using the `:=` operator, but you won't need to use it for this question.

Next hint will show the solution...
```

```{r question_2-solution}
formula <- '
  musical_ability ~ a*rhythm
  musical_ability ~ b*pitch
  pitch ~~ rhythm
'
```

```{r question_2-check}
checker()
```

### Question 3

Below is a path diagram for a model. Create an object that holds the `lavaan` formula for this model.

![](images/Question_3.png)

```{r question_3-setup}

```

```{r question_3, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines = 12}
formula <- '
  
'
```

```{r question_3-hint-1}
Make sure to use the exact variable names as the path diagram.
```

```{r question_3-hint-2}
You do not need to label any of the paths.

Next hint will show the solution...
```

```{r question_3-solution}
formula <- '
  V4 ~ V1 + V2 + V3
  V3 ~ V1
  V2 ~ V1
'
#OR
formula <- '
  V4 ~ V1
  V4 ~ V2
  V4 ~ V3
  V3 ~ V1
  V2 ~ V1
'
```

```{r question_3-check}
checker()
```

### Question 4

Edit the code below to run the SEM model from Question 3 using the data.frame saved as `Q4_data`. Answer the following question about the results.

```{r question_4-setup}
Q4_data <- data.frame(V1 = c(-0.79,-1.24,0.43,0.9,0.54,-0.09,-0.46,-0.91,-0.1,0.29,1.04,0.31,-0.99,-0.46,0.33,-0.59,-1.59,-0.1,-2.02,0.39,-1.46,-0.4,1.82,0.5,-0.34,0.91,-2.08,-0.77,-1.34,-1.41,-0.6,0.41,0.41,-0.61,0.48,-0.73,-1.43,2.93,0.5,-0.15,0.91,1.54,-0.77,-0.61,-0.06,0.61,0.87,0.05,-0.66,0.4,-2.58,0.19,-0.11,-0.56,-0.02,0.21,-1.05,0.29,1.04,0.01,0.66,-1.36,0.18,-0.42,-0.2,-0.11,0.83,-0.12,-0.41,0.8,-0.04,-0.1,-1.48,-0.03,-0.08,-0.3,0.83,1.39,-0.48,-1.13,-1.27,0.18,-2,0.97,-0.75,0,-0.3,-1.36,1.65,0.73,0.14,0.99,0.21,-0.15,-0.35,1.02,0.18,1.24,-0.25,0.49),

The path diagram shows two possible mediators. Therefore, to answer the question below, you may need to define the indirect effect of each mediator, as well as the direct effect of V1 on V4.

### Question 5

You're interested in measuring the social anxiety of children, so you observe the behaviour of 90 children across 5 social situation and give them a score on social anxiety for each ranging from 1 to 9. You wish to test whether a latent variable of 'social anxiety' underpins the scores across the 5 social situations. Run a Confirmatory Factor Analysis using `lavaan` functions. Save the formula as `formula` and the model as `ss_model`.

### Question 6

Below is a path diagram of two correlated latent variables from the data.frame `Q6_data`. Create and run the model using `lavaan` functions to determine the correlation between latent variables. Save the formula as the object `formula` and the model from the `sem()` function as `model`.

Latent variables are specified using the `=~` operator. Correlated variables are specified using the `~~` operator.
```

```{r question_6-hint-2}
To get the 'standardised solution', you will need to specify `standardized = TRUE` within the `summary()` function.

Next hint will show the solution...

#A possible solution:
formula <- '
  latent1 =~ V1 + V2 + V3
