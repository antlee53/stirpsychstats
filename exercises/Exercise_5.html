<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the fifth weekly exercise. These exercises are designed to reinforce content taught each week. Typically, they consist of quiz questions and R exercises that require you to enter code into a box. These exercises are split into beginner and advance sections. It is expected that students can complete the beginner sections of each weekly exercise, with the advanced sections designed for students who want an extra challenge or learn additional functions in R.If you are struggling, each exercise comes with a number of hints that may be helpful.</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>You’ve measured the reaction time of participants who have either drunk coffee or not. Use the <code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarise()</code> functions to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Data.frame is saved below as an object called <code>coffee.data</code>. Save the result as <code>coffee.summary</code> and name the variables <code>rt_mean</code> and <code>rt_sd</code> respectively.</p>

<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>You decide to replicate your study above using a within-subjects design. So rather than have separate groups who have either had coffee or not, you test 40 participants twice each, once before they’ve had coffee, and once after. Conduct a paired-samples t-test from the <code>coffee.data2</code> data.frame below. Then select the correct option from the ones below.</p>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>You are interested in whether hormonal contraception use in women is associated with risk-taking behaviours. You collect a sample of 50 participants; however, a few participants report as being men. First, remove the men from the data.frame, then conduct an independent-samples t-test to determine whether women who are taking hormonal contraception (as oppose to not) are more risk-taking. The data is saved in the object <code>hc_data</code>. Save the data without men as <code>hc_data_women_only</code>. Save the output for the t-test as <code>hc_t.test</code>.</p>

<h3>Question 7</h3>
<p>You’re interested in the development of mental time travel across species. You develop a comparative behavioural test and collect data on 40 individuals across 5 species (data.frame saved as <code>time.data</code>). Run a One-Way ANOVA to determine if there is a difference in performance on the task across species. Save the results from the <code>aov()</code> function (after it has been tidied using the <code>tidy()</code> function) to an object called <code>time.aov</code>.</p>

<p>In the code box below, there are three data.frames named <code>data1</code>, <code>data2</code>, and <code>data3</code>. Each data.frame has a categorical IV and a continuous DV. Determine whether a parametric or non-parametric test is appropriate for each data.frame. You may need to call the data.frame or plot the variables to determine their properties.</p>

<h3>Question A2 - Mann-Whitney U Test</h3>
<p>The Mann-Whitney U Test is a non-parametric test for when you have a categorical IV (with two levels) and a continuous DV. The equivalent parametric test is an independent-samples t-test. The function that runs a Mann-Whitney U Test is the <code>wilcox.test()</code> function. It’s a bit confusing that the Mann-Whitney U Test uses a function with a different name, but the reason for this is because the Mann-Whitney U Test could be considered as an ‘unpaired’ version of the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.</p>
<p>To conduct a Mann-Whitney U Test, you need to specify the two things needed for all analysis functions: the formula, and the data.frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wilcox.test(DV ~ IV,data = data)</code></pre>
<p>You attempt to conduct an exact replication the same study from Question 2 and 3, investigating the effects of coffee vs no coffee on reaction time. However, you are not able to collect a big sample size this second time around, so you’re considering whether a non-parametric test is more appropriate. This data is saved as a data.frame named <code>coffee.data2</code>.</p>
<p>Conduct a Mann-Whitney U Test to determine whether there is a significant difference between reaction time between the coffee and no coffee groups.</p>

<h3>Question A3 - Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test</h3>
<p>The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test is a non-parametric test for when you have a within-subjects categorical IV (with two levels) and a continuous DV. The equivalent parametric test is an paired-samples t-test. Similar to how an indpendent-samples t-test and a paired-samples t-test use the same function, the Mann-Whitney U Test and the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test also use the same function: <code>wilcox.test()</code>. The difference here is the <code>paired</code> argument must be set to <code>TRUE</code> - the same as if you were conducting a paired-samples t-test with the <code>t.test()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wilcox.test(DV ~ IV,data = data,paired = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>In the code box below, you run a study investigating the amount of sleep patients with sleep apnoea get before and after a treatment. However, it is difficult to find participants that meet this criteria, so you are only able to collect data on 8 participants. This data.frame is named <code>sleep.data</code>.</p>
<p>Conduct a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the amount of sleep patients get before and after treatment.</p>

<h3>Question A4 - Kruskal-Wallis Test</h3>
<p>The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric alternative to the one-way ANOVA, meaning it is used when you have a categorical IV with more than 2 groups, and a continuous DV. The function to conduct the Kruskal-Wallis test is <code>kruskal.test()</code>. Again, with all statistical test functions, you need to supply the formula and the data.frame you wish to analyse.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kruskal.test(DV ~ IV,data = data)</code></pre>
<p>In the code box below, you have run a study investigating unhealthy mobile phone usage between two separate interventions with a control group. This data.frame is saved as <code>mobile.data</code>. Data appears to be skewed, so you consider running a non-parametric test.</p>
<p>Conduct a Kruskal-Wallis Test to determine whether there is a significant difference the three groups.</p>
