<h1>Content</h1>
<div id="r" class="section level2">
<h2>R</h2>
<p>R is a programming language and free software environment for
statistical computing and graphics. R is widely used by statisticians
and data scientists. The use of R in psychological research has shown a
substantial increase in popularity recently, given R’s superior ability
to conduct advance statistical techniques, high level of community
support, and ability to promote reproducible research. “Base R” consists
of a “Read Evaluate Print Loop” (REPL) command interpreter, in which you
type in text commands, which are evaluated, and the results of which are
printed to the screen. Where you type in your commands for R to evaluate
it is called the console.</p>
</div>
<div id="rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>RStudio</h2>
<p>“Base R” can be unwieldy and lacks some quality-of-life features that
makes using R difficult. In particular, when you are developing a
script, you will want to work in a text editor and send commands to the
console, rather than typing directly into the console. Thankfully,
RStudio, which is a wrapper for Base R, provides this additional
functionality and a graphical user interface that can make programming
in R much easier. All teaching for this module will be done using
RStudio. This is what the RStudio User Interface looks like (don’t worry
about the details for now):</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="images/RStudio%20Interface.jpg"
alt="RStudio User Interface" />
<div class="figcaption">RStudio User Interface</div>
</div>
<p>The user interface provides multiple windows in additional to the
console that greatly facilitate developing code in R. We will go through
each window and their function below:</p>
<p>The bottom left window is the console. This is where you execute
code.</p>
<p>The top left window is the script editor. This is where you write and
edit your code before sending it to the console. This is what you save
when saving your work.</p>
<p>The top right window shows objects in the environment. When coding in
R, you will need to save objects to call upon later. Don’t worry too
much about this now - we will cover this later in this week’s
demonstration content.</p>
<p>Finally, the bottom right window can have various functions,
including showing plots, files in the working directory, or show help
documentation. We will cover these things in the coming weeks.</p>
</div>
<div id="before-we-start" class="section level2">
<h2>Before we start…</h2>
<p>We are about to start coding. If you are anxious about coding, know
that there are no penalties for making mistakes. R will be good at
telling you if something doesn’t work, and when that happens, you will
be given unlimited opportunities to try again. A valid coding strategy
is just to change something and see what happens.</p>
<p>Also, be prepared to make a lot of typos. Often, these are very
simple mistakes that even seasoned programmers make. At times, it may
get frustrating, but your ability to spot typos will come with more
experience. Common typos include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misspelling words/variable names.</li>
<li>Using an underscore (_) instead of a full stop (.) and vice
versa.</li>
<li>Capitalising the wrong letters.</li>
<li>Having too many/few brackets.</li>
<li>Having an extra comma somewhere (or missing one).</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also be exposed to many error messages, and at first they
will probably not make a lot of sense to you (copying an error message
into Google is an easy way to help find a solution!), but reading
through them carefully can give you an indication on where the mistake
is. Again, your ability to understand error messages will come with
exposure to them.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-as-a-calculator" class="section level2">
<h2>R as a calculator</h2>
<p>We are first going to learn about how to interact with the console
(bottom left window). Generally, you will be writing R scripts rather
than working directly in the console window. We will be covering more
about scripts next week, but a good way to think about it for now is
that code entered into the console will happen immediately, while code
you draft in a script can be saved for later.</p>
<p>One simple way to learn about the R console is to use it as a
calculator. Enter the lines of code below and see if your results
match.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1+2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>Remember, R will “read” the command you have typed into the console,
evaluated it in the background, and then print the response back to
you.</p>
<p>R is not sensitive to spaces, so you can put as many spaces in
between your commands as you’d like. This is helpful for long commands,
which you can break up over multiple lines.</p>
<p>This…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1 + 2 + 3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6</code></pre>
<p>… is the same as this…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1+2+3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6</code></pre>
<p>However, you cannot include a space in the middle of the object, so
if you are trying to add the numbers “12” and “3” together, the
following code will give you an error message.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1 2 + 3</code></pre>
<p>You can also break up commands over multiple lines - this is useful
for long commands. When the symbol in the console before the cursor
shows a <code>&gt;</code> symbol, it will accept a new command. If it
shows a <code>+</code> symbol, R is waiting to receive the end of the
previous command. If you want to cancel, press the esc key. For complex
functions, it may take R a while to evaluate some code. When R is still
thinking, there will be no symbol.</p>
<p>Try running the code below one line at a time.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1 + 2 + 3 +
  4 + 5</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 15</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="objects" class="section level2">
<h2>Objects</h2>
<p>Often when coding, you will want to store the result of some
computation for later use. You can store it as an object. To save
something as an object, use the ‘less than’ symbol followed by a dash:
<code>&lt;-</code> to assign the name on the right, the value on the
left (think of it as an arrow).</p>
<p>The code below saves the evaluation of 1+2 to the object name “x”.
Note that when saving an object, it does not print the result back at
you.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- 1+2</code></pre>
<p>You can then call upon this object later:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>You can also use this object in future commands. The following
command takes the object “x” and multiplies it by 2.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x * 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6</code></pre>
<p>Notice that when you save an object, it is added to the list in the
top right window of RStudio. This window displays your workspace.
Objects in your workspace exist until you overwrite them, clear your
workpsace, or until you end your R session. For big projects, it may be
helpful to save your workspace, but in general, best practice for
reproducible psychological research is to clear your workspace at the
end of each session.</p>
<p>Some things to be aware of when naming objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capitalisation matters (e.g., <code>myObject</code> is different to
<code>myobject</code>).</li>
<li>You cannot use symbols or spaces, except for underscores
<code>_</code>, and periods <code>.</code>.</li>
<li>You can use letters and numbers, but the object name must begin with
a letter (<code>b2</code> is valid, but <code>2b</code> is not).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>A lot of what you do in R involves calling functions and storing the
results. Generally, functions accept objects as arguments, executes a
pre-specified set of computations on those objects, then return the
result of those computations.</p>
<p>Functions will always follow this general syntax:</p>
<p><code>function_name(argument1,argument2,argument3,...)</code></p>
<p>Functions can do different things, depending on the function. Most
functions will take an argument (or several arguments), does a specified
computation, then return a value. For instance, the <code>sqrt()</code>
function below takes one argument (called “x”), which is a number and
returns the square root of that number:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sqrt(x = 4)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<p>Some functions can do quite complicated things. For example, the
function <code>rnorm()</code> generates random numbers from the standard
normal distribution. This function takes three arguments, where n is the
number of randomly generated numbers you want, mean is the mean of the
distribution, and sd is the standard deviation. The default mean is 0,
and the default standard deviation is 1. So if you want to randomly
generate 10 numbers, you can run this code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rnorm(n = 10,mean = 0,sd = 1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  0.2873099  0.9098147 -1.4631209 -0.3655853  0.8991687  0.2530025 -0.5642769 -0.8815648 -0.4282346 -0.4774547</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned above, some arguments have default values, in which case
you do not have to specify them. The code below does the same as above,
but we do not have to name all the arguments because the defaults for
mean and sd are 0 and 1 respectively. However, it is necessary to
provide a value for n, as there is no default.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rnorm(n = 10)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  0.2146751 -0.3590544 -0.1610150  0.1289017  2.0609812 -0.1273038  0.5288979  0.6115576  0.2671569 -0.4201220</code></pre>
<p>If you want to be even more efficient, if you specify your arguments
in the order listed for the function, you don’t have to even name them.
For example, the code below does the same thing as the two lines above,
but since we are specifying the arguments in the specific order, we
don’t have to name them.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rnorm(10,0,1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  0.06937713 -0.24462857 -0.44550474  1.21691994 -0.61147545 -0.47725400  0.08826343  1.25839345 -0.10489770 -0.68020156</code></pre>
<p>If you have trouble remembering the arguments a particular function
takes, you can hover your mouse over the function and a pop up window
will give you the function details.</p>
<p>Base R comes with a lot of in-built functions, but one of the great
things about R is that there is a large community writing functions and
including them in packages for free. Packages are like add-ons that can
expand the number of functions you can use in R. We will be covering
more about packages next week.</p>
</div>
<div id="classes" class="section level2">
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>Up to this point, we have exclusively been dealing with numeric
objects, but R can handle various data types (known as classes). There
are two that are key to understanding programming in R and content for
this module.</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="24%" />
<col width="55%" />
<col width="20%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Class</th>
<th>Descrption</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>numeric</td>
<td>Numbers</td>
<td><code>1</code>, <code>.5</code>, <code>-.33</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>character</td>
<td>Text String</td>
<td><code>"hello world"</code>, <code>"something else"</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The general rule is that numeric objects must be a number, and
character objects must be contained within quotations (e.g., “this is a
character string”).</p>
<p>There are some other class types that are useful to know:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="24%" />
<col width="55%" />
<col width="20%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Class</th>
<th>Descrption</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>factors</td>
<td>A special type of character class where each unique text string
represents a separate group (i.e., categories).</td>
<td><code>"this is a group"</code>,
<code>"this is a different group"</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>logical (or boolean)</td>
<td>A special type of factor class where the only two valid groups are
TRUE and FALSE</td>
<td><code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are also some other classes (e.g., different types of numeric
classes, such as double, and integer), but you don’t have to worry about
those for now.</p>
<p>Some functions only work on certain types of classes (e.g., it does
not make sense to calculate the square root of a character class!), so
it is useful to know what type of class your data is. You can use the
<code>class()</code> function to find out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>class(&quot;this is a character&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>class(TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;logical&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="vectors" class="section level2">
<h2>Vectors</h2>
<p>Up to now, we have only been dealing with single values. Often it is
necessary to perform a function on several values at once.</p>
<p>Vectors are one of the key structures in R. A vector is like a list
of ordered values (called elements). All the elements in a vector must
be the same class (e.g., numeric, character). You can create a vector by
using the function <code>c()</code>, where each element in your vector
is separated by a comma.</p>
<p>The following code makes a numeric vector three elements long.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>c(1,2,3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1 2 3</code></pre>
<p>This code makes a character vector five elements long.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>c(&quot;I&quot;,&quot;love&quot;,&quot;statistics&quot;,&quot;so&quot;,&quot;much&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;I&quot;          &quot;love&quot;       &quot;statistics&quot; &quot;so&quot;         &quot;much&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Vectors are useful because it allows R to perform an operation on
several values at once. For example, the following code creates an
object called “v”, which is a numeric vector. We can then multiply all
elements in a vector by three in one line of code. The output of the
following code is a three element numeric vector with the answers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>v &lt;- c(1,4,9)

v * 3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  3 12 27</code></pre>
<p>Some functions can be applied to vectors to perform the operation on
all elements at once. For example, the following code gets the square
root of each of the numbers in the object <code>v</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sqrt(v)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1 2 3</code></pre>

<div id="data.frames" class="section level2">
<h2>data.frames</h2>
<p>In psychological research, one of the main data structures we deal
with are data tables (called a data.frame in R). This is what one looks
like:</p>

<p>Typically in psychological research, how to read a data table is that
each participant is represents a separate row, while different variables
that participants can vary on our represented by separate columns
(including ID, age, sex, and three other random variables).</p>
<p>So in the data.frame above, participant 1 is a 19-year-old female,
while participant 2 is a 22-year-old male. Can you see how to get this
information from looking at the table above?</p>
<p>One way of thinking about a data.frame in R is that it is made up of
several vectors stacked up next to each other (i.e., each column is a
separate vector). If we think of it this way, we can create a data table
in R using the <code>data.frame()</code> function, where each argument
is a new column, which is a vector with the values. Data.frames can be
saved as an object in R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- data.frame(ID = c(1,2,3,4,5),
                   age = c(18,20,21,19,29),
                   sex = c(&quot;male&quot;,&quot;female&quot;,&quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;,&quot;female&quot;),
                   var1 = c(1,4,5,3,7))
data</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   ID age    sex var1
## 1  1  18   male    1
## 2  2  20 female    4
## 3  3  21 female    5
## 4  4  19   male    3
## 5  5  29 female    7</code></pre>
<p>Manually entering data like this is not a particularly efficient way
of loading data, and is prone to errors through typos. We will be
covering how you can load data saved on your computer into R next
week.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can view an entire data.frame in RStudio. The
first way, like above, is to type the data.frame object name into the
console. However, for big data.frames, this becomes unwieldy. A better
way is to use the <code>View()</code> function. Try typing the following
code into your console:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>View(data)</code></pre>

<div id="looking-for-help" class="section level2">
<h2>Looking For Help</h2>
<p>We have covered a lot of the basics today, and it’s a lot to take in.
While it is good to learn the basic syntax of R coding, note that it is
also impossible to commit to memory what every function does in R, and
even experienced R programmers will need to look up help or
documentation. This can be done in several ways.</p>
<p>Using the <code>help()</code> function. Try running the code below
and see what happens. You should see in the bottom right window of
RStudio some documentation for the function you’ve asked for help. It
will give you a list of arguements the function accepts, and detail on
what will be produced. If you scroll to the bottom, you will also see
some examples of the function in action.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>help(rnorm)</code></pre>
<p>Another way to find help is to Google things. Some useful phrases to
Google include: “how to do x in R” or “x function in R”. If you are
getting an error message you can’t solve, try copying it into a Google
Search. Often, someone on the Internet has previously asked the same
question as you, and someone else has already answered it! A good
website for this is <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, a powerful resource to supplement your learning are AI tools
such as ChatGPT. ChatGPT is useful for helping you understand code,
providing a template that you can adapt for your own purposes, or
finding simple typo errors in code quickly. However, you should not rely
on ChatGPT to write code for you. <a
